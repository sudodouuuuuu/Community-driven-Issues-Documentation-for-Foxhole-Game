![CDIDFG banner](stormcannon.png)
## Purpose
Community-driven Issues Documentation for Foxhole is a repository for the organization of bug reports, contributed by the community, intended for [Foxhole Game](https://www.foxholegame.com/).

## Mission
* Knolling
	* No current public place exists for the over-organization of bug reports, without idle chatter.

* Track (mostly) everything
	* This project may shadow [#bug-reports](https://discord.gg/w74qcssfvr) on the official Foxhole Game Discord server, bug reports on the [Official Foxhole Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/foxholegame), or anywhere else.
	
* Promote permanence
	* Repeated reports of the same bug will be omitted and pointed to the same issue.  Game world issues are not included in this point.
